# Scenario

Firstly, suspend your disbelief. This is a little contrived ;)

We (your team) have been tasked with generating more traffic to our deals page. We have had an idea that we could include a playable game in adverts on third-party sites. Completing the game successfully would allow the user to click through to a special deals page. For example we might advertise on a football related site, and offer a ‘special lowest price’ deal on a games console bundled with a popular football game. Our hypothesis is that by enticing the user to spend a few minutes playing the game, they’ll feel a sense of engagement and be more likely to purchase from the deals page.

Rather than build something from scratch, we have investigated if there are any off the shelf solutions for this and have found an open-source [sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) game that provides game functionality over an HTTP interface.

We need to assess the application to gain an understanding about its quality and if there are any issues that need to be addressed before we would be prepared to build new features.

# Your task

Complete REVIEW.md in the root of this repo by reviewing all aspects of the application. When reviewing, try to convey the following:
- What do you like?
- What flaws can you identify and why do you think they are problems? What could be done to improve them?
- Given a scenario where you could only implement one of your improvements, which would it be and why?
